This is a project based on descriptive data analysis and plotting some nice graphs. The dataset comes from the real world and was supplied by an online platform that connects startups with investors worldwide. Background information and description of the data are to be found in the Jupyter-Notebook “CrowdfundingPlatform”.

Skills applied:
•	Descriptive analysis
•	Identifying and replacing missing values
•	Optimizing memory usage
•	Feature engineering
•	Customizing tables in pandas
•	Creating graphs in Plotly Express

When I am viewing the notebook in nbviewer it won’t display choropleth maps and I couldn’t find a solution yet; the only way I see to have all the graphs displayed and interactive is to download and open the html-file with the same name, CrowdfundingPlatform (also available on Google Drive, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UiI10P0G6c9WnnHmQTPzWb98sasraEWX/view?usp=sharing).
