Regression modelling of Burnout score
This project is an attempt of regression modelling of a metric score based on a combination of metric and categorical parameters. 
The dataset has been taken from https://www.kaggle.com/blurredmachine/are-your-employees-burning-out.

Skills applied:
•	Descriptive analysis
•	Optimizing memory usage
•	Data preprocessing for machine learning (imputing missing values, scaling metric variables, encoding categorical variables)
•	Fitting different models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor)
•	Cross-validation of the models
•	Fine-tuning of model parameters with Grid Search
•	Application of the Voting Regressor
