This project is an attempt to predict sales of cosmetic products for some next weeks, based on historic sales data. It is not finished yet: I plan to re-fine my forecasts with ARIMA and XGBoost and try some other methods, for example, LSTM. 

Project goal: Prediction of sales for several next weeks, based on the two-yearsâ€˜ history of sales
Learning goal: Making acquaintance with some supervised machine learning method or methods which can deal with time-series data and are used for metric predictions of this kind (sales, consumption, demand, etc.)
Dataset: a seemingly real data from a seller of cosmetics, care, and beauty products, taken from Kaggle
Selected methods: ARIMA, XGBoost 
Result: XGBoost wins by a large margin :) However, many things are still to try, including other methods.
